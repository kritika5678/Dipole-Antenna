# Dipole-Antenna

A dipole antenna is one of the simplest and most widely used antennas, made of two equal-length conductors, commonly used for RF transmission and reception.

**PROCEDURE**

1) In the experiment we drew two cylinders one outer (Cylinder 2) and one inner (Cylinder 1).

2) Cylinder 1 has the material set as Copper and cylinder 2 had the material Air.

3) Cylinder 1 has radius 1 mm and height 15 mm. It also has a duplicate cylinder named Cylinder 1_1.
4) Cylinder 2 has radius 50 mm and height 400 mm. It is used as radiation box.
5) Duplicate cylinder was created in order to create a small gap between the concentric cylinders.
6) A rectangle was also inserted inside the cylinders the rectangle was oriented wrt to the X axis
   Position of rectangle: (0, -1, -0.5)  Y size: 2 mm  Z size: 1 mm
7) The excitation was passed using the rectangular faces , lumped port was chosen.
